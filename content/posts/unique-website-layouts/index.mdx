Three days ago I came across Canal Street Market's [website](https://canalstreet.market), built by [Zero Studios](https://zero.nyc) in NYC. I was
fascinated by how well each page transition and animation was implemented and wondered to myself if
I was able to recreate a UI like that.

In this post I want to break down how I was able to recreate the page navigation with each page's
content fading in and out. Here's how the final product looks:

<Image src={gif3} alt="Canal Street Demo" />

Here are the moving parts:

- Setting up the nav links
- Animating the nav when page first loads
- Animating the nav when transitioning between pages
- Fading out and in page content on route change

The full repository can be found on [Github](https://github.com/timc1/layouts) and the live demo can
be found [here](https://layout-experiments.netlify.com/canalstreet.market/).

Let's get started!

### Setting up the nav links

There are two parts to the nav ‚Äî the first is the actual `nav` with each link nested within and
second is a layer of styled `divs` that hold the background color of each section.

If you take a look at this image, you can see that each section doesn't have a background color, but rather the
color is provided from the layer that animates in and out with the nav links. This is a bit
different from how Zero Studios did it, but it works üòú. You can check it out if you toggle the
opacity of the layer:

Anyway, the nav is a fixed position nav menu that spans from the top of the viewport to the bottom. Here's
the basic structure (the styled version can be found [here](https://github.com/timc1/layouts/blob/master/src/canalstreet.market/index.tsx)):

```tsx
<header>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      {/* Each `li` is has a fixed width of 60px, aliased as var(--nav-link-width). */}
      <li>
        <span>‰∏ªÈ°µ</span>
        <span>Home</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>È§êÈ•Æ</span>
        <span>Food</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Ë≥ºÁâ©</span>
        <span>Retail</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>ÊñáÂåñ</span>
        <span>Community</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    {/* Here are the background layers */}
    <div>
      <span />
      <span />
      <span />
      <span />
    </div>
  </nav>
</header>
```

Using css `writing-mode: vertical-lr`, we're able to display the nav text vertically, and set the
Chinese letters to an absolute position.

With that, we'll have our menu looking like this:

<Image src={image1} alt="Fixed position, colored navigation links" shadow />

The only state I used was a number value, `openIndex`, that represents the current open link. This is
managed by a `useReducer`. Whenever a route change occurs, we'll update the `openIndex`.
When the `openIndex` is updated, we'll then trigger animation updates.

I'm sure there are other ways to do this nicely, but I found it pretty easy to work with it this
way.

```tsx
type StateType = {
  openIndex: number
}

type ActionType = {
  type: string
  payload?: {
    [k: string]: any
  }
}

const reducer = (state: StateType, action: ActionType) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SET_OPEN_INDEX':
      return {
        ...state,
        openIndex: action.payload.index,
      }
    default:
      throw new Error(`No type of ${action.type} found.`)
  }
}

export default function CanalStreetMarket(props: any) {
  const { section } = props.match.params

  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, {
    openIndex: (() => {
      switch (section) {
        case 'food':
          return 1
        case 'retail':
          return 2
        case 'community':
          return 3
        default:
          return 0
      }
    })(),
  })
}

const links = [
  { url: url, text: 'Home', chinese: `‰∏ªÈ°µ` },
  { url: `${url}/food`, text: 'Food', chinese: `È§êÈ•Æ` },
  { url: `${url}/retail`, text: 'Retail', chinese: `Ë≥ºÁâ©` },
  { url: `${url}/community`, text: 'Community', chinese: `ÊñáÂåñ` },
]
```

One more thing ‚Äî to handle animations, we'll need to target three DOM elements:

- The element wrapping our nav links
- The element wrapping our page's content
- The element wrapping our background layers

Using `useRef`, we can keep a reference of these nodes:

```tsx
//const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, {
//    openIndex: (() => {
//      switch (section) {
//        case 'food':
//          return 1
//        case 'retail':
//          return 2
//        case 'community':
//          return 3
//        default:
//          return 0
//      }
//    })(),
//  })

const listRef = React.useRef<HTMLUListElement>(null)
const content = React.useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)
const transitionCoverRef = React.useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)

// ...
```

### Animating the nav when page first loads

When the page initially loads, we want to position the nav
links based on which route we're currently on. So, if we were on the `/retail` route, we'll want
both 'home' and 'retail' links to be positioned left of the screen. Remember, which route we are on
is represented by our state value, `openIndex`.

Here I used a `useEffect` along with a ref, `initialRender`, which will let us know if this effect
is firing on the component mounting or not.

\*Note: It's probably more beneficial to use `useLayoutEffect` because we want to calculate the
position prior to the browser's painting, but since our elements are initially transformed out of
view, it didn't really seem to matter.

```tsx
const initRender = React.useRef(false)
React.useEffect(() => {
  const links = Array.from(listRef.current.querySelectorAll('li'))
  if (initRender.current) {
    // Logic for transitioning nav items by x axis
  } else {
    // Transition elements by y axis only if initial mount.
    initRender.current = true
    links.forEach((link, index) => {
      if (index <= state.openIndex) {
        link.style.left = `${index * 60}px`
        link.style.right = `unset`
      }
      link.style.transform = `translateY(0)`
      link.style.transformOrigin = `0 0`
      link.style.transition = `transform ${TRANSITION_DURATION *
        6}ms var(--ease)`
      link.style.transitionDelay = `${-100 * index}ms`
    })
  }
}, [state.openIndex])
```

Look! On initial load, we absolutely position each link based on the current `openIndex`, then
transform them down to view.

### Animating the nav when transitioning between pages

Let's add the logic for transitioning the nav links after the first load.

The first thing I thought of when working on this section is the importance of not animating the
`left` and `right` properties of the links and the background layers but rather the `transform`
properties of each element to create that smooth 60fps transition. Paul Lewis and Paul Irish have a
great article on this you can read about [here](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/high-performance-animations/).

So here's the idea:

- When `openIndex` updates, we'll figure out which of the nav links and their respective background layers need to move.
- We calculate how much each element will need to `translate` in order to slide over to the
  opposing side of the screen.
- We transform the elements over smoothly
- Once the transition completes, we'll immediately absolutely position the elements to THAT position
  that they're currently located.

In the above function, let's fill in the logic for transitioning the nav items by the x axis. Note
here that we're using a ref, `previousOpenIndex`, which will keep track of... you guessed it, the
previous `openIndex`! This will help us determine which elements should transition. Let's see:

```tsx
if (initRender.current) {
  if (previousOpenIndex.current !== undefined) {
    if (state.openIndex > previousOpenIndex.current) {
      const elements = links.slice(0, state.openIndex + 1)

      // Fade content out
      if (content.current) {
        content.current.style.opacity = '0'
        content.current.style.transition = `opacity ${ANIMATION_DELAY}ms var(--ease)`
      }

      elements.forEach((el, index) => {
        const position = el.getBoundingClientRect() as any
        el.style.transform = `translateX(${-1 * (position.x - index * 60)}px)`
        el.style.transition = `transform ${TRANSITION_DURATION}ms var(--ease)`
        el.style.transitionDelay = `${ANIMATION_DELAY}ms`

        setTimeout(() => {
          if (el) {
            el.style.transform = `translateY(0)`
            el.style.transitionDelay = ``
            el.style.transition = ``
            el.style.left = `${index * 60}px`
            el.style.right = `unset`

            // Fade content back in.
            if (content.current) {
              content.current.style.opacity = '1'
              content.current.style.transition = `opacity ${ANIMATION_DELAY}ms var(--ease)`
              content.current.style.transitionDelay = `${ANIMATION_DELAY}ms`
            }
          }
        }, TRANSITION_DURATION + ANIMATION_DELAY)
      })
    } else {
      // Don't move home link.
      const elements = links.slice(state.openIndex + 1)

      // Fade content out. We can split this to another function üò¨.
      if (content.current) {
        content.current.style.opacity = '0'
        content.current.style.transition = `opacity ${ANIMATION_DELAY}ms var(--ease)`
      }

      elements.forEach((el, index) => {
        const position = el.getBoundingClientRect() as any
        const innerWidth = window.innerWidth

        el.style.transform = `translateX(${innerWidth -
          (position.x + 60 * (elements.length - index))}px)`
        el.style.transition = `transform ${TRANSITION_DURATION}ms var(--ease)`
        el.style.transitionDelay = `${ANIMATION_DELAY}ms`

        setTimeout(() => {
          if (el) {
            el.style.transform = `translateY(0)`
            el.style.transitionDelay = ``
            el.style.transition = ``
            el.style.left = `unset`
            el.style.right = `${60 * (elements.length - 1 - index)}px`
          }

          // Fade content back in. Ya we can split this to another function too üò¨.
          if (content.current) {
            content.current.style.opacity = '1'
            content.current.style.transition = `opacity ${ANIMATION_DELAY}ms var(--ease)`
            content.current.style.transitionDelay = `${ANIMATION_DELAY}ms`
          }
        }, TRANSITION_DURATION + ANIMATION_DELAY)
      })
    }
  }
} else {
  // ...
}
```

Let's also add the transitions to the background layers:

```tsx
// Transitions for background transition layer. useUpdatedLayoutEffect
// is a wrapper around useLayoutEffect that returns a boolean value, `premount`,
// which lets us know if the current effect that is fired is fired on the initial
// component mount.
useUpdatedLayoutEffect(
  (premount: boolean) => {
    if (transitionCoverRef.current) {
      const backgrounds = Array.from(
        transitionCoverRef.current.querySelectorAll('span')
      )

      if (premount) {
        backgrounds.forEach((bg, index) => {
          if (index > state.openIndex) {
            bg.style.transform = `translateX(calc(100% - calc(var(--nav-link-width) * 2)))`
            bg.style.opacity = `0`
          } else if (index !== state.openIndex) {
            bg.style.opacity = `0`
          }
        })
        return
      }

      backgrounds.forEach((bg, index) => {
        if (index <= state.openIndex) {
          bg.style.transform = `translateX(0px)`
          bg.style.opacity = `1`
          bg.style.transition = `transform ${TRANSITION_DURATION}ms var(--ease) ${ANIMATION_DELAY}ms`
        } else {
          bg.style.transform = `translateX(calc(100% - calc(var(--nav-link-width) * 2)))`
          bg.style.transition = `transform ${TRANSITION_DURATION}ms var(--ease) ${ANIMATION_DELAY}ms`
        }
      })
    }
  },
  [state.openIndex],
  true // Premount - pls make this more clear lol üôÉ
)
```

Now our nav is transitioning nicely. Both on initial load, and subsequent
route changes. Cool, almost done!

### Fading out and in page content on route change

On each route change, we want to time transitions so that our current page content fades away -> nav
animates -> content fades back but with updated page's content.

To make this transition, I initially tried `react-transition-group`, but it seems like
`<TransitionGroup />` from the library causes a browser repaint on initial mount so our nav links weren't able to animate on the first load.

Using `react-pose`, things worked well and really without much work. We can wrap our content body
with the library like so:

```tsx
import posed, { PoseGroup } from 'react-pose'

// ...

return (
  {/* ... */}

  <PoseGroup>
    <RoutesContainer key={props.match.url}>
      <Switch location={props.location}>
        <Route path={`${url}`} exact component={Home} />
        <Route path={`${url}/food`} exact component={Food} />
        <Route path={`${url}/retail`} exact component={Retail} />
        <Route path={`${url}/community`} exact component={Community} />
      </Switch>
    </RoutesContainer>
  </PoseGroup>

  {/* ... */}
)

const RoutesContainer = posed.div({
  enter: { opacity: 1, delay: ANIMATION_DELAY },
  exit: { opacity: 0, delay: ANIMATION_DELAY },
})
```

One route change, Pose will transition our previous and next components smoothly by transitioning
each component's `opacity`.

And there we have it, a really cool and unique layout! There's definitely more optimal ways of
implementing this UI, and if you want to take an attempt at recreating Canal Street's site, share
how you implemented it!

Best of luck on building your UI!
