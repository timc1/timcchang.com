React makes building UIs really fun. I've been experimenting with the new
[Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html) feature for some time now
([here](https://github.com/timc1)) and recently found a neat way to handle
animations that depend on user interaction & scrolling.

I recently created a landing page which has a fixed navigation that shows a
progress bar for how much content is left to read as well as a highlight for
each 'active' section.

The full demo is available to play with live
[here](https://codesandbox.io/s/o599joo75z).

In this post I will attempt to explain and cover how to efficiently create a
navigation like above.

### What we will cover

1. Setting up the markup
2. Create a hook to track when an element intersections with the viewport or
   another element
3. Use the hook to trigger animations updates to the UI

Let's get started!

### Setting up the markup

We're going to need a few `<sections />` that distinguish the start and end to
each. We'll give each section a unique color and heading.

We're using [emotion](https://emotion.sh) to style our components.

In demo.js:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { styled } from '@emotion/styled'
import Nav from './nav'

export default function Demo() {
  const sections = [
    { id: 'home', header: 'Home' },
    { id: 'about', header: 'About' },
    { id: 'products', header: 'Products' },
    { id: 'pricing', header: 'Pricing' },
    { id: 'jobs', header: 'Jobs' },
  ]

  return (
    <Container>
      <Nav sections={sections} />
      <Section ref={bannerRef} data-section-id="banner">
        <Heading>Banner</Heading>
      </Section>
      {sections.map(section => (
        <Section
          key={section.id}
          // data-section-id will be a data attribute we
          data-section-id={section.id}
        >
          <Heading>{section.header}</Heading>
        </Section>
      ))}
    </Container>
  )
}

// styles
const Container = styled.div`
  section:first-of-type {
    background: #25283c;
    color: #fdffdf;
  }
  section:nth-of-type(2) {
    background: #fff6e2;
    color: #000;
  }
  section:nth-of-type(3) {
    background: #200623;
    color: #fff;
  }
  section:nth-of-type(4) {
    background: #ffda83;
    color: #042996;
  }
  section:nth-of-type(5) {
    background: #00674a;
    color: #fff;
  }
  section:nth-of-type(6) {
    background: #fff;
    color: #000;
  }
`

const Section = styled.section`
  height: 100vh;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
`

const Heading = styled.h1`
  margin: 0;
  font-size: 3rem;
`
```

Next, lets create our sticky navigation in a separate file, `nav.js`:

```js
import React from 'react'
import styled from '@emotion/styled'

export default function Nav() {
  return (
    <Aside>
      <Items>
        {sections.map(section => (
          <Item key={section.id}>
            <NavLink to="#">{section.header}</NavLink>
          </Item>
        ))}
        <li className="scaler" aria-hidden="true" />
      </Items>
    </Aside>
  )
}

// styles
const Aside = styled.aside`
  position: sticky;
  top: 50%;
  opacity: 1;
  transition: opacity 0.25s ease-out;
  mix-blend-mode: difference;
  padding-left: 25px;
`

const Items = styled.ul`
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  transform: translateY(-50%);
  margin: 0 0 0 25px;
  padding: 0 0 0 25px;
  list-style: none;
  display: grid;
  grid-gap: 20px;

  &::before {
    content: '';
    background: rgba(212, 212, 212, 0.4);
    position: absolute;
    top: -50%;
    bottom: -50%;
    width: 1px;
  }

  .scaler {
    background: #fff;
    position: absolute;
    top: -50%;
    bottom: -50%;
    width: 1px;
    transform-origin: 0 0;
    transform: scaleY(0);
    transition: transform 0.25s ease-out;
  }
`

const Item = styled.li``

const NavLink = styled.a`
  color: #fff;
  font-weight: 600;
  text-decoration: none;
  padding: 8px 15px;
  font-size: 12px;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  text-transform: uppercase;
`
```

With these styles, we should see this now:

<Image src={video1} alt="" />

### Using IntersectionObserver to track when elements intersect with the viewport or another element

Usually when we want to track elements' positions on the screen, we need to do
something like

```js
window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll)

const handleScroll = () => {
  elements.forEach(element => {
    const position = element.getBoundingClientRect()
    if (elementIsInViewport) {
      // animate in
    }
  })
}
```

Quickly we'll notice that we're firing off hundreds of events per second, making
calculations to check if the element is in view, on the main thread. Though
that'll work, it is inefficient, hard to maintain, and also will make your
computer go 🔥🥵.

IntersectionObserver is an implementation that provides a way to "asynchronously
observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element
or with a top-level document's viewport."
([reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)).
What this means for us is a very efficient way to track a user's current
position on the screen, without us to have to set up individual listeners. We
provide a callback and a few options to the API, and it will call our callback
only when the element has entered or left the boundary we provide.

This boundary defaults to the document viewport, but can be other elements as we
will see later.

Here's a basic implementation of the API:

```js
const options = {
  rootMargin: '0px',
  root: null, // null defaults to the document viewport
  threshold: 1.0, // trigger when 100% of the target is visible within the element defined by root
}

const observer = new IntersectionObserver(entries => {
  entries.forEach(entry => {
    if (entry.isIntersecting) {
      // do something
    }
  }, options)
})

observer.observe(document.getElementById('my-element-that-needs-tracking'))
```

Now turning this into a React Hook is super simple:

```js
import { useEffect } from 'react'

// We pass refs to the observer so we can access
// the actual reference to the dom node we are targeting
export default function useIntersectionObserver({
  refs,
  callback,
  options = {
    rootMargin: '0px',
    root: null,
    threshold: [0.9, 1],
  },
}) {
  // Setup our api here
  useEffect(() => {
    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(entries => {
      entries.forEach(entry => {
        callback({
          isIntersecting: entry.isIntersecting,
          target: entry.target,
          observer,
        })
      })
    }, options)

    refs.forEach(ref => {
      observer.observe(ref.current)
    })

    // Cleanup when the component unmnounts
    return () => observer.disconnect()
  }, [])
}
```

What's happening here is we're creating a reusable component that sets up and
cleans up a new observer without us actually having to instantiate a new
IntersectionObserver every time we want to use one.

We pass an object parameter with three properties, `refs`, `options`, and
`callback`.

`refs` is an array of refs that we'll use to reference actual DOM nodes,
`options` is an object of
[options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API#Creating_an_intersection_observer)
that we pass along to the observer, and `callback` is the callback we want to
trigger when our observer intersects with something. Our callback will be called
with an `isIntersecting` boolean property, the `target` element that was
intersected, as well as the `observer` itself. This way, we create an
[inversion of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) to
allow the user of our hook to disconnect the observer (observer.disconnect())
whenever they see fit!

\*A `ref` is a method of accessing a DOM node within a render function
([docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html)). Our
IntersectionObserver hook is going to take these refs and asynchronously track
the position of the DOM nodes that they reference.

Okay, let's integrate this hook into our demo.

### Toggling the sticky menu's visibility

As we see in the demo, the sticky menu only appears when the top banner is out
of view.

To do this, we need to:

1. Create a ref to pass to the `<Banner />` component
2. Use our useIntersectionObserver hook with the banner ref
3. Use React's built in `useReducer` hook to manage our state
4. In our useIntersectionObserver hook's callback, dispatch an action to change
   the `isNavShowing` state of our `<Nav />` to `false` when the banner is in
   view, and vice versa when the `<Banner />` is not.
5. Pass the `isNavShowing` state down to our `<Nav />`

In demo.js:

```js
// ...

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SHOW_NAV':
      return {
        ...state,
        isNavShowing: true,
      }
    case 'HIDE_NAV': {
      return {
        ...state,
        isNavShowing: false,
      }
    }
    default:
      return state
  }
}

const initialState = {
  isNavShowing: false,
}

// ...

export default function Demo() {
  // ...

  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)

  // An IntersectionObserver hook for showing the <Nav /> when
  // the <Banner /> leaves the view.
  useIntersectionObserver({
    refs: [bannerRef],
    callback: ({ isIntersecting }) => {
      if (isIntersecting) {
        dispatch({ type: 'HIDE_NAV' })
      } else {
        dispatch({ type: 'SHOW_NAV' })
      }
    },
    options: {
      // a threshold of 0 will trigger our IntersectionObserver at the
      // base of the element – a threshold of 1 would trigger at the top.
      threshold: [0],
    },
  })

  return (
    <Container>
      <Nav sections={sections} isShowing={state.isNavShowing} />
      // ...
    </Container>
  )
}
```

In nav.js, we'll need to take the `isShowing` prop and toggle a few styles
depending on its value:

```js
// ...

const Aside = styled.aside`
  position: sticky;
  top: 50%;
  opacity: ${props => (props.isShowing ? 1 : 0)};
  transition: opacity 0.25s ease-out;
  mix-blend-mode: difference;
  padding-left: 25px;
`

// ...
```

Now, we'll see our `<Nav />` hide and showing like so:

<Image src={video3} src="" />

### Keeping track of the currently focused section

As we scroll past each individual section, we want to have the sticky navbar
update the color of the current section that we're on, like so:

<Image src={video2} alt="" />

In order to create this, just like with the `<Banner />` earlier, we need to
create `refs` to pass along to each `section`. They will be the reference for
our IntersectionObserver to keep track of.:

In our demo.js file:

```js
import React, { useReducer, useRef } from 'react'

// These refs will be passed to their respective <section /> components in order for us to keep
// a reference of the DOM elements and their position.
const navRef = useRef(null)
const bannerRef = useRef(null)
const homeRef = useRef(null)
const aboutRef = useRef(null)
const productsRef = useRef(null)
const pricingRef = useRef(null)
const jobsRef = useRef(null)

// We'll update our sections array to include each section's ref
const sections = [
  { id: 'home', header: 'Home', ref: homeRef },
  { id: 'about', header: 'About', ref: aboutRef },
  { id: 'products', header: 'Products', ref: productsRef },
  { id: 'pricing', header: 'Pricing', ref: pricingRef },
  { id: 'jobs', header: 'Jobs', ref: jobsRef },
]

// ...

// An IntersectionObserver hook for updating which navigation
// list item is currently in focus, based on which DOM element
// is currently in the viewport.
let currentSection, previousSection
useIntersectionObserver({
  refs: [homeRef, aboutRef, productsRef, pricingRef, jobsRef],
  callback: ({ isIntersecting, target }) => {
    const sectionData = target.getAttribute('data-section-id')
    if (isIntersecting) {
      dispatch({
        type: 'TOGGLE_SECTION',
        payload: {
          sectionId: sectionData,
        },
      })

      previousSection = currentSection
      currentSection = sectionData
    } else {
      if (currentSection === sectionData && previousSection) {
        currentSection = previousSection

        dispatch({
          type: 'TOGGLE_SECTION',
          payload: {
            sectionId: previousSection,
          },
        })
      }
    }
  },
  options: {
    // *** Notice we pass navRef.current to the IntersectionObserver API options
    //     which effectively sets our <Nav /> component as the root of intersection.
    //     The refs passed to IntersectionObserver will trigger when they intersect
    //     with this root.
    root: navRef.current,
    threshold: [0.5],
  },
})

return (
  <Container>
    <Nav sections={sections} ref={navRef} />
    <Section>
      <Heading>Banner</Heading>
    </Section>
    {sections.map(section => (
      <Section key={section.id} data-section-id={section.id} ref={section.ref}>
        <Heading>{section.header}</Heading>
      </Section>
    ))}
  </Container>
)

// ...
```

In our nav.js file, we need to take the `navRef` and
[forward the ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html) to
`<Nav ref={navRef} />`

```js
// ...

export default React.forwardRef(function Nav(
  { sections, beginningContent, endContent, isShowing, currentSection },
  ref
) {
  // ...

  return (
    <Aside ref={ref} isShowing={isShowing}>
      // ...
    </Aside>
  )
})
```

Let's look at the hook logic we have –

When the IntersectionObserver triggers, it'll call our callback function which
will in turn:

1. Check which element was intersected and save it in a variable `sectionData`.
   This is done through using javascript's
   Element.getAttribute('data-section-id'), which we explicitly passed to each
   `<Section />`
2. If it is intersecting (entering), we'll dispatch an update to the reducer we
   created earlier, passing in the `currentSection`
3. If it is _not_ intersecting, we'll do a check to see if the user actually
   scrolled to the previous section, and dispatch an update to update the
   `currentSection` back to the `previousSection`.

There's definitely a better way to do this, send me a message if you think of
one!

Let's update our reducer function and add a new case

```js
// ...

  case "TOGGLE_SECTION":
    return {
      ...state,
      currentlyFocusedSection: action.payload.sectionId
    };

// ...
```

and pass the state to our state down to our nav.

```js
// ...
<Nav currentSection={state.currentlyFocusedSection} />
// ...
```

In our nav.js file, we'll update the styles to reflect the `currentSection`:

```js
// ...
return (
  // ...
  <Item key={section.id} isActive={section.id === currentSection}>
    <NavLink to="#" tabIndex={isShowing ? 0 : -1}>
      {section.header}
    </NavLink>
  </Item>
  // ...
)

// ...

const Item = styled.li`
  > a {
    color: ${props => (props.isActive ? '#fff' : 'rgba(78, 78, 78, 0.5)')};
  }
`
```

We're almost done! Here's how things should be looking:

### Animating a scaling progress bar

The last thing we need to do is animate the progress bar on the sticky nav.

To do this, we will not be using the IntersectionObserver hook, but just a
`scroll` event listener.

The basic idea is:

1. Calculate the `totalHeight` between the top of the element that we want to
   begin the scrolling and the bottom of the end of the element that we want to
   end the scrolling.
2. Create a `scrollEvent` that calculates how much content is left to scroll and
   set the style `<li className="scaler" />`
3. Trigger a `scroll` event when the `<Nav />` is showing
4. Remove the `scroll` event when the `<Nav />` is hidden

In order to calculate the `totalHeight`, we need to know which elements are the
start and end of the scrolling content.

To do this, let's pass our `homeRef` and `jobsRef` from demo.js down to our
`<Nav />`:

```js
<Nav
  ref={navRef}
  sections={sections}
  beginningContent={homeRef}
  endContent={jobsRef}
  isShowing={state.isNavShowing}
  currentSection={state.currentlyFocusedSection}
/>
```

and in our nav.js file:

```js
export default React.forwardRef(function Nav(
  { sections, beginningContent, endContent, isShowing, currentSection },
  ref
) {
 // ...
}

// ...
```

We're almost done!

Create a `scalerRef` in our `<Nav />` component and pass it to our
`<li className="scaler" />` in order to reference it (because we're going to be
manipulating its `style` property dynamically.

Then, we'll add an effect which triggers only on mount, unmount, and each time
`<Nav />`'s `isShowing` prop changes:

```js
// ...
const scalerRef = useRef(null)
useEffect(
  () => {
    const {
      top: topOfBeginning,
      bottom: bottomOfTop,
    } = beginningContent.current.getBoundingClientRect()
    const { bottom: bottomOfEnd } = endContent.current.getBoundingClientRect()

    // We will be using totalHeight to calculate how much content is left to scroll
    const totalHeight = bottomOfEnd - topOfBeginning

    // Setup our scroll event
    const scrollEvent = () => {
      if (topOfBeginning <= window.scrollY) {
        const percentage = (window.scrollY / totalHeight).toFixed(2)
        scalerRef.current.style.transform = `scaleY(${percentage})`
      } else {
        scalerRef.current.style.transform = `scaleY(0)`
      }
    }

    if (isShowing) {
      window.addEventListener('scroll', scrollEvent)
    } else {
      window.removeEventListener('scroll', scrollEvent)
      // Reset scroller to 0
      scalerRef.current.style.transform = `scaleY(0)`
    }

    // Cleanup before unmount
    return () => window.removeEventListener('scroll', scrollEvent)
  },
  [isShowing]
)

return (
  // ...
)
```

And there we have it!

Wrapping our heads around Hooks and this way of building React apps may be
confusing at first, but after working with Hooks for a bit, you'll realize how
powerful they can be to building awesome UIs.
