While building the dashboard menu interface for my side project, I wanted to make the transitions
between each menu opening and closing smooth. After a few iterations and going through different
concepts of how to tackle this requirement, I found that a combination of a compound component
paired with a render prop worked great - giving the end API user little to no additional work.

Here's how the current implementation looks:

<Image src={demo} alt="react animated menu demo" shadow />

The repository can be found on [Github](https://github.com/timc1/react-animated-menu) and the
library can be installed as a dependency in your project.

```
npm install --save react-animated-menu

or

yarn add -D react-animated-menu
```

In this post I will go over the specifics of how this implementation works. Here's the timeline:

1. UI requirements
2. State management - Why use both a compound component and a render prop?
3. Building our compound component
4. Building our render prop

## UI requirements

1. Given a markup structure like the following, we want to dynamically animate in and out the menu's
   `ul` based on whether that specific menu is open.

```html
<aside className="menu">
  <button>Dashboard</button>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="/dashboard/home">Home</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="/dashboard/manage-users">Manage Users</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <button>Account</button>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="/account/profile">Profile</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="/account/settings">Settings</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="/account/privacy">Privacy</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</aside>
```

2. Let our component manage all state and logic for opening and closing menu items based on
   its internal state â€” exposing only the necessary properties for our end user to plug and play and just
   make things work.

3. Allow our end user to specify:

- How many menu items can be open at once
- Which menu items are initially opened
- The opening/closing animation speed and ease

## State Management

I decided to go with a combination of using a compund component, `DynamicMenu`, for the main component, which our
user will wrap around their entire menu component, and a render prop `MenuItem`, for each item within the menu.

So in the above example, the compound component will wrap the entire `aside` while each `button`/`ul` combo will be
wrapped by the render prop. This is how we want to use the component:

```js
import DynamicMenu, { MenuItem } from 'react-animated-menu'

export default function Menu() {
  return (
    <aside>
      {/* Wrap the menu in a Higher Ordered Component */}
      <DynamicMenu
        initialOpenIndex={0}
        easeDuration={150}
        numberOfMenusThatCanBeOpenedAtOnce={1}
      >
        {/* Each menu toggler and the menu list content must be wrapped by a MenuItem
            render prop - and spreading the prop getters to their respective sections. */}
        <MenuItem>
          {({ isOpen, getToggleProps, getMenuProps, getLinkProps }) => (
            <>
              <button {...getToggleProps()} isOpen={isOpen}>
                Dashboard
              </button>
              <ul {...getMenuProps()}>
                {dashboardPaths.map(p => (
                  <li key={p.route}>
                    <Link to={`/${p.route}/`} {...getLinkProps()}>
                      {p.name}
                    </Link>
                  </li>
                ))}
              </ul>
            </>
          )}
        </MenuItem>
      </DynamicMenu>
    </aside>
  )
}
```

#### DynamicMenu

Our compound component will manage a single state, `currentOpenIndex`, which is an array of numbers
representing the index of open menu items. It will pass a prop, `isOpen`, to all child `MenuItem`
components.

#### MenuItem

Nested within `DynamicMenu` is any number of `MenuItem`s.

This component, given the `isOpen` prop from `DynamicMenu`, will return a series of prop getters
that our end user will use to spread values onto their own components.

Let's dive deeper into each component!

## Building our compound component

Using `React.Children.map`, we can map through each child node of a component and, if a specific
condition that we set is matched, we can use `React.cloneElement` to pass additional props to the
component.

Because we want to check every nested child from `DynamicMenu`, we'll create a recursive
implementation of `React.Children.map`.

```js
export default function DynamicMenu({ children }) {
  // For now, just set the current open index to 0,
  // the first MenuItem component.
  const [currentOpenIndex, setOpenIndex] = React.useState(0)

  const mapPropsToChildren = children => {
    let indexOfMatchedChildrenComponents = 0

    const recursiveMap = children => {
      return React.Children.map(children, child => {
        if (!React.isValidElement(child)) {
          return child
        }

        if (child.type.displayName === MenuItem.displayName) {
          const cachedIndex = indexOfMatchedChildrenComponents
          child = React.cloneElement(child, {
            onClick: () => setOpenIndex(cachedIndex),
            isOpen: cachedIndex === currentOpenIndex,
          })
          indexOfMatchedChildrenComponents++

          return child
        }

        if (child.props.children) {
          child = React.cloneElement(child, {
            children: recursiveMap(child.props.children),
          })
        }

        return child
      })
    }

    return recursiveMap(children)
  }
  return mapPropsToChildren(children)
}
```

So, let's break down what's happening here. Our `DynamicMenu` will recursively map through each
child component and increment a count, `indexOfMatchedChildrenComponents`, for each `MenuItem` that
is found. If the child component is a `MenuItem`, it will apply two props to the component:
`onClick`, which will update the `currentOpenIndex` state, and `isOpen`, a boolean value to flag
whether this specific `MenuItem` is open.

Taking the `isOpen` prop, let's create our `MenuItem` component, which will take the prop and update
the UI.

## Building our render prop

`MenuItem` will expose a few prop getters for our end user to use spread across their respective components:

- `getToggleProps` - adds ARIA attributes and click events to the menu button/toggler
- `getMenuProps` - adds ARIA attributes and a `ref` to the menu for our component to reference the DOM node and manipulate its CSS properties
- `getLinkProps` - adds `tab-index` values to links within a menu item based on whether the menu is
  open or not

Let's set that up:

```js
export function MenuItem(props) {
  const { isOpen, onClick } = props
  const container = React.useRef()

  const getToggleProps = () => ({
    onClick: isAnimating ? () => {} : onClick,
    'aria-haspopup': true,
    'aria-expanded': isOpen,
  })

  const getMenuProps = () => ({
    ref: container,
    'aria-hidden': !isOpen,
  })

  const getLinkProps = () => ({
    tabIndex: isOpen ? '0' : '-1',
  })

  return children({
    getToggleProps,
    getMenuProps,
    getLinkProps,
    isOpen,
  })
}

MenuItem.displayName = `MenuItem`
```

The primary logic behind this component comes from a single effect hook. Every time our
`isOpen` prop updates, we'll want to determine how to handle transitioning the menu element's
`height`.

> Let's not do that right now. ðŸ˜³

Every time the `isOpen` prop is updated from `DynamicMenu`, this component will run an [effect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#uselayouteffect):

```js
export function MenuItem(props) {
  // ...
  // const container = React.useRef()

  // A flag to tell if we are coming from an initial render.
  // On initial render we won't want to do any animating,
  // but just immediately set the position.
  const initialRender = React.useRef(false)
  // Cache the height of our menu item on initial load
  // so when we animate we'll know how much the target
  // height will be.
  const cachedHeight = React.useRef(0)
  React.useLayoutEffect(() => {
    const node = container.current
    if (!node) {
      throw new Error(
        `The component that you apply getMenuProps to 
        will need to be wrapped in a React.forwardRef(). 
        Please see: https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html`
      )
    }

    let animationId = -1
    let animationStartTime: any = null
    let from = 0
    let to = 0

    // We will use requestAnimationFrame to transition the
    // list's height.
    const animateHeight = () => {
      const difference = to - from
      const elapsed = Date.now() - animationStartTime

      animationId = requestAnimationFrame(animateHeight)

      if (elapsed < 250) {
        cancelAnimationFrame(animationId)
        let ease: number = Number(easeFn(elapsed / 250).toFixed(2))

        if (difference < 0) {
          ease = 1 - ease
        }

        const height = Math.abs(ease * difference) + 'px'
        node.style.height = height
        node.style.opacity = String(ease)
        node.style.position = 'relative'

        animationId = requestAnimationFrame(animateHeight)
      } else {
        // Reset height to auto if we're scaling up.
        if (difference < 0) {
          node.style.height = '0px'
          node.style.opacity = '0'
        } else {
          node.style.height = 'auto'
          node.style.opacity = '1'
        }

        cancelAnimationFrame(animationId)
        setAnimating(false)
      }
    }

    // We only animate after the component has already
    // initially rendered.
    if (initialRender.current) {
      animationStartTime = Date.now()
      setAnimating(true)

      if (isOpen) {
        // Animate open.
        from = 0
        to = cachedHeight.current
        animateHeight()
      } else {
        // Animate close.
        from = cachedHeight.current
        to = 0
        animateHeight()
      }
    } else {
      // We'll use setTimeout here because on initialRender,
      // it seems like getBoundingClientRect returns a slightly
      // off value for the element's size. With setTimeout,
      // we'll get an accurate size.
      setTimeout(() => {
        cachedHeight.current = node.getBoundingClientRect().height
        // Once we have the accurate height of the element, we'll
        // set its height to 0px. Since everything is hidden we
        // won't see any flashes.
        if (!isOpen && node) node.style.height = '0px'
      }, 100)

      if (isOpen) {
        node.style.opacity = '1'
        node.style.position = 'relative'
      } else {
        node.style.opacity = '0'
        node.style.position = 'absolute'
      }
      node.style.overflow = 'hidden'

      initialRender.current = true
    }

    // Cleanup.
    return () => cancelAnimationFrame(animationId)
  }, [isOpen])

  // ...
}
```

A few things are happening here â€”

1. On initial load, we'll cache the original height of the node that our `container` ref is
   referencing. This will allow us to know how much to programatically resize our menu during
   animation.
2. If we're coming from an initial render, we immediately size the elements; if not, we'll
   smoothly transition the resizing.
3. When implementing a smooth `height` transition, we use `requestAnimationFrame` to use
   Javascript to manipulate the menu's height over a set `duration` (In our example, 150ms).

And that should be it! We now have two components, leveraging both the compound component and render
prop model to create two simple components that handle all logic for building on an accessible and
snappy menu UI.
