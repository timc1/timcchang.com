My current side project requires authorized users to create events. This time around I wanted to try out Google's Firebase
â€” after a bit of research, docs, and playing around with the examples, I was amazed at how simple
authentication can be!

Firebase exposes a series of APIs that handle _all_ user authentication - we can simply wrap the
APIs with a single, reusable component.

In this post we will be creating a single React hook that uses Firebase to easily manage user
authentication that you can use throughout your app.

Here's how it can be used:

```js
const authorizedRoutes = [
  { path: '/', exact: true, component: Index },
  { path: '*', exact: true, component: () => <Redirect to="/" /> },
]

const noUserRoutes = [
  { path: '/login', exact: true, component: Login },
  { path: '/signup', exact: true, component: Signup },
  { path: '/reset-password', exact: true, component: ResetPassword },
  { path: '*', exact: true, component: () => <Redirect to="/login" /> },
]

export default function App() {
  const context = useAuth()
  const routes = context.user ? authorizedRoutes : noUserRoutes

  return (
    <Layout>
      <Router>
        <Switch>
          {routes.map(r => (
            <Route key={r.path} {...r} />
          ))}
        </Switch>
      </Router>
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

Instead of publishing the code as a module, I just created a gist
which you can find on [Github](). Simply copy and paste it into your app, and edit the code based on your
needs!

We'll go over the following:

1. Setting our component
2. Initiating Firebase
3. Implementing signup, signin, and sendResetEmail methods
