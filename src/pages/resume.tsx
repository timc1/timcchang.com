                In mid 2017 I made a decision to put full efforts toward
                learning web development. It is something that's always been of
                interest, but with many things creative, I had imposter
                syndrome. I bit the bullet, moved down to LA, and started
                learning and making things.

                    I developed an interactive micro landing page for Ryan Blake

                    Because of its single page layout, I opted to build the

              <p>
                I joined Verlocal after coming back from my year long venture in
                Asia. My role at Verlocal was a juggle between developing our
                Pro product pipeline, maintaining Pro client relations, and
                acquiring more Pro users. Pro is an online booking & events
                management software. We built Pro as a pivot from a B2C
                marketplace website towards a B2B SaaS company.

                  <p>
                    This sounds nice — though it was the collective effort of
                    the entire team to build Pro, a good enough product that our
                    early customers actually paid $$ for.

                I spent a year working and living in Shanghai, China. This was

                whole different cultural environment. During this time I played
                a small role in the development and content management of
                Vicinity Centre's shopping centers in Australia as well as a
                site for Shanghai Multimedia Association. I was very fortunate
                to have been given the opportunity to learn here.

                This was another job I am extremely grateful to have had. I was
                1/3 of the pilot product operations team. With no past
                experience, we were able to partner with Safeway, FoodsCo, GSO,
                and OnTrac to develop a logistics food delivery system paired
                with the Handpick iOS app. We successfully delivered over 2500
                meal kits within 2 months of launching. Mornings were spent in
                the office planning and strategizing long term plans while
                afternoons were spent with the team in the basement of Safeway
                at Market St., packing and listening to music.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most importantly I developed long term, great friendships with
                the people here.
